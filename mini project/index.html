            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>Chandrayaan-3 is India's third lunar exploration mission, launched in 2023. It is designed to study the Moon's surface and environment, including the presence of water and other resources. Chandrayaan-3 will be the first mission to land on the Moon's south pole, a region that is believed to be rich in resources. The mission is expected to provide valuable insights into the Moon's history, geology, and composition. Chandrayaan-3 is a significant mission for India, as it will make India the fourth country to land on the Moon.</p>

The initialization of Chandrayaan-3 was a complex process that involves multiple steps. The spacecraft is assembled and tested individually,from various parts of the nation then integrated and tested together. It is then prepared for launch, including fueling and loading it onto the launch vehicle. The spacecraft is then launched into orbit and deployed to the Moon. Finally, the lander lands on the Moon and deploys the rover.

S Somanath, the Chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), played a crucial role in the success of the Chandrayaan-3 mission. He implemented a strategy focused on eliminating failures, which led to the successful soft landing of the Vikram lander on the Moon's South Pole.

Somanath also attributed the success of the mission to the "rigour of the reviews" and the "corrective action taken meticulously". He emphasized that the launch of the LVM-3 rocket and its placing the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft into its earth-bound orbit was the "most critical event" of the mission.

Under Somanath's leadership, ISRO was able to learn from the failures of the Chandrayaan-2 mission and make the necessary changes to ensure the success of Chandrayaan-3. He also instilled a sense of confidence and determination in the team, which was essential for the mission's success.
